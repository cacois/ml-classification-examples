# Machine Learning for Modern Developers

Code examples from my talk "Machine Learning for Modern Developers‚Äù,
first given at Pittsburgh TechFest 2014.

## Setup

This code requires the Python machine learning library scikit-learn, and a few other things. The easiest way to make this happen is to install Anaconda, the scientific python distribution. It has everything you need out of the box:

## Run Code

Each script is standalone:

Classification using Linear Regression:

<code>
python linear-regression.py
</code>

Classification using Support Vector Machines:

<code>
python svm.py
</code>

A pretty plot of results using a number of SVM variants:

<code>
python plot_iris.py
</code>
